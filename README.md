# StripSVN
This is a handy application I built a while back that will strip all the hidden SVN files in a folder recursively. If you have copied a folder without exporting it, that whole server structure is full of hidden SVN files that will not allow you to commit the files to another SVN repo. Thankfully SVN is (almost) a thing of the past. Enjoy!
