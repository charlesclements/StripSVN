# StripSVN
This is a handy application I built a while back that will strip all the hidden SVN files in a folder recursively. If you have copied a folder without exporting it, that whole folder structure is full of hidden SVN files that will stop you from committing the files to another SVN repo. Deleting the hidden files manually may prove to be a tedious process. Thankfully SVN is (almost) a thing of the past. Until then, you may need this app for your tool box. Enjoy!
